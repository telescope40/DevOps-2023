# Network Lab Challenge 1  

In this scenario you have a pair of routers you administer (r1 & r2) that uplink two each other and to an ISP provider.

You have to solve for Ping not reachable between 

- server1 -> h3
- server1 -> h4
- server2 -> h3
- server2 -> h4
- server1 -> server2

All of the configuration that needs to be fixed is in either r1 and/or r2. 
You can access all of the devices in the topology

In order to pass the challenge your solution need to pass the ``netlab validate`` test 
The ``netlab validate`` test will run a series of pings and validate the results

You can troubleshoot by connecting to the devices and making changes to the configuration
Run time changes can be test with the ``netlab validate`` command

Resolution should be a Pull Request to this repo with the changes you made to the topology.yaml or any other files needed

Successful Validation should look like this 
```bash
root@netlab/bgplab# netlab validate
[wait]    Waiting for BGP to stabilize

[ping1]   Server1 Ping to H3 [ node(s): server1 ]
[PASS]    Validation succeeded on server1
[PASS]    Test succeeded

[ping2]   Server2 Ping to H4 [ node(s): server2 ]
[PASS]    Validation succeeded on server2
[PASS]    Test succeeded

[ping3]   Server1 Ping to Server2 [ node(s): server1 ]
[PASS]    Validation succeeded on server1
